Why hello there!

I am Daan, a MSE student at the technical University in Eindhoven. I am currently really hungry and don't feel like writing a long bit about myself.


This edit has been performed after I have eaten and is done to fulfill the tasks specified in the selfstudy instruction.
After this text has been edited, I will try to merge it with the master using the GIT GUI application
